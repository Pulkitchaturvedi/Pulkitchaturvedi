👋 Hi, I’m @Pulkitchaturvedi

👀 I’m interested in Test Automation, Quality Assurance, and developing robust testing frameworks for mobile applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning and working on test automation for mobile testing using native language (Kotlin (Android) and SwiftUI (iOS) automation) and flutter apps.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that emphasize test strategy, automated testing (including mobile, API, and backend), and DevOps integration.

📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn or via email at pulkitchaturvedi87@gmail.com
